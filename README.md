## Mental Health Chatbot (Simplified Example)
## Project Title: Simple Mental Health Chatbot

## Problem Statement:  To create a basic chatbot that can offer a sense of connection and encourage self-reflection for users who may be experiencing mild emotional distress or simply want someone to talk to.  This is not a replacement for professional help.

## Solution Overview: A Python-based chatbot that uses keyword matching and limited conversation memory to provide simple, supportive responses.  It reflects on recent user inputs to encourage further discussion.

## Tech Stack:

Python: Programming language
(Potentially) Libraries: random (built-in), sentiment analysis libraries (e.g., VADER, TextBlob) could be added for enhanced functionality.

## Setup and Installation Instructions:

Python: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
Code: Save the Python code (provided in the previous responses) as a .py file (e.g., chatbot.py).
Run: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run the chatbot using python chatbot.py.
## Contribution Summary:

This project is a basic implementation for educational purposes. Contributions could include:

Enhanced Responses: Adding more varied and contextually relevant responses.
Sentiment Analysis: Integrating sentiment analysis to better understand user emotions.
Improved Conversation Memory: Implementing a more sophisticated way to track and use conversation history.
External Knowledge Integration: Connecting to external resources to provide more information.
User Interface: Creating a graphical user interface (GUI) for a better user experience.
Ethical Considerations: Adding safeguards and disclaimers to emphasize the chatbot's limitations and encourage professionalÂ help.
